# Database Systems

This repository holds the submitted coursework for my Database Systems module. The module taught the basics of managing a database using SQL.
The coursework revolved around a database for a proposed haulage company and is split into two separate portions, part 1 and part 2. 

Part 1 involved creating a series of SELECT statements to retrieve specified data from the database, while part 2 required the alteration of the database to create desired changes.

The haulage.sql file is used to create the initial given database. Below is a diagram of the initial database:
